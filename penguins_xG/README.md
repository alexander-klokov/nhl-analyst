# 2024 Penguins xG

## Motivation

By the end of February 2024, the Pittsburgh Penguins boasted solid expected goals (xG) statistics, placing 11th across the league. However, their performance in actual goals scored was less impressive, ranking at 25th position. This stark contrast presents a challenge in their bid for playoffs, despite being a formidable team. In this project, I explore patterns that could provide insight into this phenomenon.

## Conclusions

Despite being a formidable team that creates numerous scoring opportunities, the Penguins currently rank as the worst in the league in converting these chances into goals. However, there has been a noticeable trend towards improved conversion over the last 5â€“6 games. This positive development could significantly enhance their prospects of securing a spot in the playoffs.
